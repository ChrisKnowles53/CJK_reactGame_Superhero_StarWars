## React Game with 2 options

### This project is being completed on top of bootcamp work

## Project Outline
The concept is to create one set of components that can be used by 2 two different games.  The user gets choose option A or option B and depeding which they chose the game will hand the correct API and data to one set of child components that will be the game.  The challenge here is the 2 apis return different data objects so that needs to be handled so that the child componenets do not have to be different for each game.

## Ideate and Plan 
We chose the superhero API to create a simple game where:
* The user chooses a superhero by name
* The computer chooses a superhero by id number
* Then we compare the power stats for both and declare who wins.  

We will then choose a second API to create the second game.

## Build your functional MVP  
Part 1 - get the game running with one API call
* Basic game up and running - used a table to display the results, as I've never used a table before.
* ⏰ add a screen shot of the MVP

Part 2 - introduce the second API  
⏰⏰this is the next step

## Style it
Once the MVP is built style it

## Stretch goal
Change the background to match the game chosen and vary this after XX games
Introduce some dynamic screens so when the game logic runs it displays Kapow or Kblam like the old retro superhero cartoons.
